\section{Mekong Delta}

In order to know what variables need to be monitored in the Mekong Delta, it is important to define the problems that it faces. In this section, these problems will be illustrated using various sources. This section will conclude with a definition of parameters which are most important to measure.\\

The Mekong River is one of the last large rivers on Earth not dammed for most of its length, flowing freely to the sea through five countries: Myanmar, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.  It discharges 16,000 cubic meters of water per second. The Mekong Basin is home to about 65 million people, of which 80\% live in the lower basin. The river is also rich in diversity, hosting about 800 fish species and over 20,000 plants. \cite{worldatlas}

The Mekong Delta is the region in southwestern Vietnam where the Mekong River approaches and empties into the sea through a network of channels. The Mekong Delta region encompasses a large portion of southwestern Vietnam of over 40,500 square kilometres.\cite{arcbc} However, the size of the area covered by water depends on the season. Its wet coastal geography makes it an important source of agriculture and aquaculture for the country




The Mekong Delta has the following soil types: \cite{arcbc}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alluvium soils}
          \begin{itemize} 
            \item These soils are found along the Tien and Hau rivers; they cover an area of 1,110,000 ha (28\% of the Vietnamese portion of the delta). 
            \item The alluvium soils are only slightly acidic (pH values of 4.5-6.5), and are suitable for the cultivation of rice.
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sulphate soils}
          \begin{itemize} 
            \item These soils are found in Ca Mau and along the shores of the Gulf of Thailand, they cover an area of 1,590,000 ha. (40\% of the Vietnamese portion of the delta). 
            \item These soils have very high concentrations of sulphates and are not acidic (pH values of 2.26-3.54)
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Salty soils}
          \begin{itemize} 
            \item These soils are found in Ca Mau and along the shores of the Gulf of Thailand. This type covers an area of 1,080,236 ha (28\% of the delta).
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
While there are many anecdotal reports available about the water availability and quality in the Mekong River, there exist relatively little data to validate these claims. Understanding what is happening to the Mekong River is a first step towards understanding what steps are necessary to mitigate problems. Such a step can only be achieved when there is sufficient monitoring, particularly monitoring over time.\\

Dams seem to cause a disturbance in the natural flow of the Mekong River, making both droughts and floods more common in the Mekong Delta. No constant stream of water upstream causes more saltwater intrusion downstream, making the agricultural industry less productive. Groundwater extraction causes subsidence, which in turn has very real consequences for the landscape of the delta.\\

As seen, the Mekong Delta's various sectors are facing numerous challenges, namely subsidence, salinization, and drought. These can be monitored by measuring variables such as conductivity, turbidity, and temperature continuously, across the Mekong River.
