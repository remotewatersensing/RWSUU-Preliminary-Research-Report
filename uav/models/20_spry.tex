\paragraph{Payload capacity}\mbox{Score: 0} \\
While the payload capacity of the Spry+ is not presented on the website, professionals state that the drone can carry up to 300g\cite{sprypayload}. This is below the minimum required payload of 500g.

\paragraph{Mounting clearance}\mbox{Score: 0.8} \\
The Spry+ is a compact drone meant for speed and therefore lacks clearance for sensors. One could create their own platform beneath the drone, utilizing the four bars.
