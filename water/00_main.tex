\section{Water Quality Parameters} \label{variables}
In this section, multiple water quality parameters are described. A combination of these known parameters help with the evaluation of the total water quality in respect to different water applications such as surface water treatment and irrigation.

A small description of every parameter will be given, after which some sensors that may be suitable for mounting on the drone will be reviewed. Some multi parameter sensor systems will also be reviewed. In the following design report, a practical stack of some sensors will be made
