\subsection{Temperature}
Temperature readings are used in the calculation of acidity, salinity, and in colorimetric tests. In limnological studies, knowledge of water temperatures as a function of depth often are required. The source of water supply, such as deep wells, often can be identified by temperature measurements alone. Surface water treatment plants also require data on water temperature at intake, as the viscosity of the water can differ. \cite{standardmethods}

\subsubsection{Sensors}
In this section, a comparison between potential temperature (℃) sensors for the project is given. Certain features like price, accuracy, and form factor will be given. The temperature sensors selected can be submerged in water.
