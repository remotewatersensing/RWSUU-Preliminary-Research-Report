\subsection{Oxidation-Reduction Potential}
To reach a state of stability, substances that are lacking electrons are desperately seeking out electrons wherever they can. On the contrary, substances which have a surplus of electrons are capable of donating their extra electrons. These are called oxidizing and anti-oxidizing agents respectively.\\

Oxidation-reduction potential, or ORP, is a measurement that indicates the degree to which a substance is capable of oxidizing or reducing another substance. ORP is measured in millivolts.\cite{phorp} If the pH of water is higher than 9.5, then ORP meters become an invalid method of water quality measurement. \cite{standardmethods}

\subsubsection{Use in water treatment systems}
Water treatment is often accomplished through the addition of chlorine. The resulting oxidation reaction with water forms hypochlorous acid. In water treatment applications ORP is used to measure the oxidation by controlling the amount of free chlorine until a known bacteria killing ORP level is achieved. \cite{hamilton}

\subsubsection{Sensors}
In this section, a comparison between potential ORP sensors for the project is given. Certain features like price, accuracy, and form factor will be given.
